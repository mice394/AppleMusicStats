### Concept
#### Overview
Apple Music Stats app is the app that bridges the one of the differences between Spotify and Apple Music: Spotify Wrapped. Spotify Wrapped is an annual social media event where Spotify users are able to see their music playing data collected over the past year and post it on their social media (e.g. Instagram) to share with their friends. The posts are typically generated pictures that Spotify creates to make it aesthetically pleasing and "instagram-able". Apple Music users are left excluded from this experience and are stuck with Apple Replay, which is not very pretty.

With the Apple Music Stats app, its users will be able to join the fun and post their music playing data on social media as well!
